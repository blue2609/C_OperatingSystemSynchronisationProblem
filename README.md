# C_OperatingSystemSynchronisationProblem
A project which involves synchronising multiple operating system requests with mutex C language by utilising POSIX thread library, semaphore and mutex locks.

*This project invovles 2 parts*: 

- The first part consists of a threaded matrix multiplication. Each thread will take several columns and process the multiplicaton between these set of columns with another matrix set of columns. 

- The second part involves solving a synchronisation problem very much akin to how operating system handles processes requests and delegations of resources. This was done using mutex locks as well as semaphores and of course, pthreading.
